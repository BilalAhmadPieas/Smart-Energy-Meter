In this week I worked on HPLC communication, I have succesfully implemented HPLC Communication for two way communication between esp8266 and EV cahrger simulator in Visual Basics.
Also I started with basics for cloud, and was albe to display SOC of EV Battery Received from Simulator on Netpie Cloud Using Wifi and ESp module.
Next week I plan to work on controlling EV cahrging through cloud and also defining EV charging scheduling algorithm.
