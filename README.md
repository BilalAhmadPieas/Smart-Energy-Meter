18-3-24 In this week I worked on HPLC communication, I have succesfully implemented HPLC Communication for two way communication between esp8266 and EV cahrger simulator in Visual Basics.
Also I started with basics for cloud, and was albe to display SOC of EV Battery Received from Simulator on Netpie Cloud Using Wifi and ESp module.
Next week I plan to work on controlling EV cahrging through cloud and also defining EV charging scheduling algorithm. 
25-03-24 In last week I am able to control EV Charging, get back EV SOC from Visual basics,Develop Power and energy consumed logic for meter, Display EV SOC and Power Consumed on cloud. also have introduced real time clock for Ev scheduling
